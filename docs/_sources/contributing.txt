Contributing
============

We welcome community contributions. To get started, you can take a look at the issues_ page and see if there's one you want to tackle. Here are other items on our road map that could make great contributions

- expand ndarray functionality (e.g. ``nansum``, ``where``)
- add ndarray arithmetic (e.g. ``+``, ``-``)
- add new constructors (e.g. ``random``)
- add new backends (e.g. ``dask``, ``ipython.parallel``)

Come chat_ with us if you want to discuss any contribution ideas!
