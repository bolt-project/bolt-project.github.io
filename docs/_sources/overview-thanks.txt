This project reflects many insightful discussions with the data science + python community, in particular: the developers of Spark and PySpark (esp. Matei Zaharia, Xiangrui Meng, and Josh Rosen), the coding sprint team on the spylearn project (esp. Olivier Grisel, Sandy Ryza, and Uri Laserson), the developers of sparkit-learn, the developers of Dask (esp. Matthew Rocklin), and the developers of x-ray (esp. Stephan Hoyer).

These doc pages were built with sphinx_ using a customized version of the `read the docs`_ theme.
